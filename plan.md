```

### Environment Setup Required:
```bash
# Add to .env file:
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<generated-fernet-key>
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./app.db
BINANCE_TESTNET=true  # or false for live trading
POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-polar-token>
POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<your-webhook-secret>
RESEND_API_KEY=<your-resend-key>  # for email notifications
```

### Database Features:
- **Persistent Storage**: All data survives app restarts
- **Encrypted API Keys**: Binance keys stored per user with Fernet encryption
- **Relational Integrity**: Proper foreign keys (User → Bot → Deal → Order)
- **Transaction Safety**: All CRUD operations use database transactions
- **Auto-Recovery**: Running bots automatically resume on startup
- **Order Cleanup**: Pending orders canceled when bots stopped
- **Credential Validation**: API keys validated before storage

### Production Workflow:
1. **App Starts** → Load running bots from database → Resume WebSockets
2. **User Adds API Keys** → Validate with Binance → Save encrypted to database
3. **Bot Created** → Validate balance → Save to database → Place base order
4. **Deal Active** → Monitor price → Place safety orders → Update database
5. **Balance Low** → Enter waiting state → Poll every 60s → Resume when funded
6. **Take Profit Hit** → Close deal → Save stats → Auto-restart new cycle
7. **Bot Stopped** → Cancel pending orders → Update database → Clean up
8. **App Restarts** → Load user's API keys → Resume all running bots automatically
